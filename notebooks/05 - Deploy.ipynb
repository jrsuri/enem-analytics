    "# Deploy and Integration with RAG/LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, strategies are explored to put the trained model into production and integrate it with systems based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Model Deployment\n",
    "To make the model available in production, a common approach would be creating a REST API using Flask or FastAPI. This API would receive input data, apply the necessary transformations, and return the model's prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main challenges and considerations:\n",
    "- Data security and privacy: as ENEM data may contain sensitive information, it would be necessary to adopt practices such as data anonymization and the implementation of authentication to access the API.\n",
    "- Scalability: depending on the request volume, it would be necessary to use a scalable hosting service, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, or a server with Kubernetes.\n",
    "- Monitoring and maintenance: the model would need to be periodically evaluated to detect performance degradation (data drift) and updated as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Integration with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "The data and insights generated by the model could be incorporated into a RAG system to improve response generation in an educational chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application example: \n",
    "- A chatbot that answers questions about ENEM could use a database with statistics and predictions based on the trained model.\n",
    "- Upon receiving questions about factors that influence exam performance, the chatbot could retrieve information from the dataset and combine it with text generation to provide more evidence-based answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Integration with LLMs (Large Language Models)\n",
    "The prediction model could be used in conjunction with an LLM to enhance study strategy recommendations or student profile analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible integrations:\n",
    "- Generation of high-performance profiles: the LLM could generate a student persona with good performance, and the prediction model would validate if these factors actually correlate with a high score.  \n",
    "- Identification of students at risk: the model could predict which students are most likely to obtain low scores, and the LLM could generate personalized study recommendations based on the identified difficulties.  \n",
    "- Personalized assistant for preparation: an AI-based system could use the model to predict a student's weak points and, with the help of the LLM, recommend study materials adapted to their needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These integrations could enhance the learning experience and offer more targeted support for ENEM candidates."
